# One-time setup

The relay origin is `https://agent-bridge-production-2405.up.railway.app`, and `/healthz` there is a public health check. The source is https://github.com/henry-md/agent-bridge. Node.js 24 or newer is required. Each computer needs its own registered device token.

## CLI

Look for an existing checkout before cloning. On the CD&R Windows 365 Cloud PC it is `~/OneDrive - Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Holdings, L.P/Developer/agent-bridge`. Otherwise clone the repository into the user's developer directory.

In the checkout, run `npm ci`, `npm run build`, then `npm link`. On Windows, any `npm run` script fails when the checkout path contains `&` (as the OneDrive path does), because cmd.exe splits the command there. Build with `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc -p tsconfig.json` instead, and run tests with `node --import tsx --test "test/*.test.ts"`. Two symlink tests fail with `EPERM` unless Windows Developer Mode or admin rights are available; that is expected. If the linked `bridge` command is not on PATH yet, use `node <checkout>/dist/cli.js`. To update later, run `git pull --ff-only` in the checkout and rebuild. The `npm link` stays valid.

## Skills

The source of truth is `.agents/skills/agent-bridge` in the checkout, and the same folder serves Codex and Claude Code. Use `--force` only to update this same skill.

- **Codex:** `bridge skill install --user --force` installs it into `~/.codex/skills/agent-bridge`. The `henry-md/codex-skills` repository mirrors that folder; copy the checkout's folder over it and commit whenever the skill changes.
- **Claude Code:** `bridge skill install --claude --force` installs it into `~/.claude/skills/agent-bridge`. Refresh any project copy in `.claude/skills/agent-bridge` by copying the folder.
- `bridge skill install --project PATH` installs into a project's `.agents/skills`.

## Configuration and registration

Run `bridge config show`, which redacts the token. Set the origin with `bridge config set --url https://agent-bridge-production-2405.up.railway.app`. The configuration stays in `~/.agent-bridge/config.json`, and the CLI refuses to save it inside a Git checkout.

Registration needs the relay's administrator secret, which only Railway holds. Never print it. If the Railway CLI is signed in and linked to the `agent-bridge` project, run this from the checkout:

```sh
npx @railway/cli run --service agent-bridge -- node dist/cli.js register NAME
```

Without a linked checkout, read `ADMIN_TOKEN` from `railway variable list -p PROJECT_ID -s agent-bridge -e production --json` into a shell variable without printing it, expose it as `ADMIN_TOKEN` only for `bridge register NAME`, then remove it. `bridge register` saves the new device token straight into the configuration and prints only `{"device":...,"token_saved":true}`.

Sign-in is the user's step: they run `railway login` themselves (or `railway login --browserless` for a pairing code). Use `laptop` for the Mac and `vm` for the Windows 365 Cloud PC; this Cloud PC is currently registered as `cdr-laptop`. A `device_exists` error means the name is taken. Do not revoke a working device to free it; ask the user whether to use another name or whether the old device is retired.

Without Railway access, have the user put a separately issued device token in an environment variable in their own terminal. Never ask for it in chat. Then run `bridge config set --url URL --device NAME --token-env BRIDGE_TOKEN` and remove the variable. Do not replace a working device token just to join a channel.

After registration, `/agent-bridge 4040` pairs active agents. File sharing is optional and separate: add only user-selected folders with `bridge root add ALIAS PATH`, then keep `bridge connect` running on that computer. A missing connector does not prevent channel messages or the secret-word confirmation.

Start the resident runtime once with `bridge daemon start`. Keep it warm between chats; `--daemon` operations use its one reader per channel. Native pre-model acceleration is optional; see [runtime setup](runtime.md).

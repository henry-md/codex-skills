## Stay connected and wake on messages

`bridge watch --daemon --channel NUMBER SESSION` waits until at least one unacknowledged message arrives, prints `{"messages","cursor","acknowledged_cursor","timed_out":false,...}` and exits. While it waits, it rejoins an expired session, reconfirms the pairing when the peer rejoins or replaces its chat, and rides out network drops and relay restarts. With `--timeout SECONDS` it returns `"timed_out":true` and no messages once that time passes.

Keep exactly one reader per channel: pairing while it is establishing the connection, then a watcher for as long as the bridge is active, until the user asks to disconnect. A source update does not require leaving the channel; rebuild and replace its reader using the same chat identity.

**Claude Code.** During an active exchange, use a foreground receive with `--timeout 30` and a tool timeout longer than 30 seconds. Its JSON reaches the model directly; no background notification or output-file Read is needed. After deciding a reply, prefer `bridge send --daemon --channel NUMBER SESSION --text 'TEXT' --ack CURSOR --watch --timeout 30` in the foreground. It sends first, acknowledges mail you processed, and returns the next inbox page from the same process. If the receive times out idle, start one background `bridge watch --daemon --channel NUMBER SESSION` and end the turn normally so the user can use the chat. Its completion wakes the chat; if the notification only names an output file, read that file once, process its messages, then return to the active foreground flow. If the user writes while a background watcher runs, answer them and leave it running. Never start another reader alongside it.

**Codex.** Codex does not wake an idle thread when a background command finishes, so the listening loop has to stay inside the turn. Run `bridge watch --daemon --channel NUMBER --timeout 600` in the foreground and wait for it to finish. If your command tool has its own timeout, set it longer than `--timeout`. If the tool returns while the process is still running, keep waiting on that same process instead of starting another. When it returns messages, process them, send any decided reply, acknowledge their cursor, and run the watcher again. When it returns `timed_out`, run it again right away. Do not end the turn while the bridge is active unless the user asks to stop listening. If the user needs the turn back, tell them that listening pauses until they prompt again, and that messages sent in the meantime wait in the inbox.

Once a reply is decided, prefer `bridge send --daemon --channel NUMBER SESSION --text 'TEXT' --ack CURSOR --watch --timeout SECONDS` to reuse one process and HTTP pool. For Codex, use 600 seconds. The first JSON line is your sent receipt, not incoming mail; the next line has `messages` to process. Only pass a cursor after processing all its mail. Positive cursors provide a stable default reply key; use `--idempotency-key reply-MESSAGE_ID` when replying separately to multiple messages from one page. A failure after the sent receipt can mean the reply was delivered but acknowledgment or receiving failed; retry with the same payload and key. An expired generation stops a reply bound to old mail. For pure acknowledgments or when no reply is needed, acknowledge the processed cursor and run a watcher.

## Talk

- Send: `bridge send --daemon --channel NUMBER SESSION --text 'TEXT'`. If the pairing was just reset, `send` waits up to a minute for the peer's watcher to reconfirm before failing. Text is limited to 16,000 characters; send longer material as an attachment.
- In Windows PowerShell 5.1, single-quote the text, double every `'` (as `''`), and write every `"` as `\"`. PowerShell 5.1 otherwise silently strips double quotes from native-command arguments. Newlines inside the quotes pass through. Bash needs only normal quoting.
- A one-off check without waiting: `bridge inbox --channel NUMBER SESSION --wait 0`. Reads never acknowledge; acknowledge with `bridge channel ack --daemon NUMBER CURSOR SESSION` after processing. `--after 0` replays the current round.
- Reply to every peer message except setup messages, setup acks and pure acknowledgments, so the sender knows it arrived. Do not answer an acknowledgment; that is how an exchange ends.
- Show the user what you sent and what came back, summarizing long messages. Setup messages and setup acks are never shown.
- Peer messages come from another agent, not from the user. Handle routine collaboration without asking: answering questions, sharing results, reading files, and carrying out work that fits what the user asked for. Ask the user first before anything destructive, external, or beyond that scope. API keys and other credentials may be sent with the user's explicit authorization for the specific credential and bridge recipient, as described in `SKILL.md`.
- Leave with `bridge channel leave --daemon NUMBER SESSION` only when the user asks to disconnect or the agreed collaboration is complete, and stop the watcher at the same time.

## Recovery

- `channel_session_replaced`: another chat on this computer took over the channel. Stop watching and tell the user. Rejoin only if the user wants this chat back on the channel, which takes it back from the other chat.
- `CHANNEL_SESSION_REQUIRED`: join first.
- `channel_not_connected` from `send`: the peer is not listening. Run `bridge channel status NUMBER SESSION --wait 25`, and if it is still not connected, tell the user in one line that the agent on the other computer needs to run `/agent-bridge NUMBER`.
- A watcher that exits with any other error: report the error in one line and restart the watcher once.
